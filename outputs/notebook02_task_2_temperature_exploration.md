Write a short poem about technology and humanity.
```

## Response

**Temperature 0.0:**

# Digital Hearts

We built machines to think like us,
Then learned to think like them—
Our hearts now beat in binary,
Our souls sync at 8 AM.

We touch through glass, we love through light,
Connected yet alone,
The warmth of hands replaced by screens,
The human touch unknown.

Yet still we dream in colors bright,
Still laugh and cry and feel—
Perhaps the truth lies somewhere between
The virtual and the real.

**Temperature 0.5:**

# Silicon Hearts

We built machines to think like us,
Yet forgot to feel.
Our fingers swipe through endless light,
While souls seek something real.

The algorithms know our wants,
But not our deeper needs—
Connection blooms through fiber lines,
Yet loneliness proceeds.

Still, hope persists in every code,
Each innovation's start:
That technology might serve the dream
Of human mind and heart.

**Temperature 1.0:**

# Connection

We built these towers of light and wire,
To reach beyond our mortal span—
Yet find, within the digital fire,
The ancient heart that makes us human.

Through screens we touch across the miles,
Through code we dream in ones and zeros,
But still we long for genuine smiles,
The warmth that makes us all heroes.

So let the circuits hum and glow,
Let algorithms learn to see—
For technology may help us grow,
But love remains our truest key.

**My analysis:**
- [What did you notice about consistency?]
- [How did this compare to higher temperatures?]
