### 1. Setup
- Install required libraries (e.g., `openai`).
- Initialize the OpenAI client (example uses local Ollama server).

### 2. Basic Prompting
- Learn to send simple prompts to the model and receive responses.
- **Exercise:** Modify prompts to ask different questions.

### 3. Summarization
- Use prompts to summarize text.
- **Exercise:** Summarize a longer article or passage of your choice.

### 4. Information Extraction
- Extract specific information (e.g., name, occupation, age, location) from text using prompts.
- **Exercise:** Extract different details from the same text.

### 5. Transformation
- Transform text from one format or style to another (e.g., translation).
- **Exercise:** Translate sentences to different languages.

### 6. Expansion
- Expand a short prompt into a more detailed response (e.g., story or poem generation).
- **Exercise:** Write creative outputs based on modified prompts.

### 7. Role-based Prompting
- Instruct the model to respond in a specific role or persona (e.g., chef, teacher).
- **Exercise:** Ask the model to explain topics in different roles.

### 8. Few-shot Prompting
- Provide examples to guide the model's responses.

### 9. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Encourage the model to explain its reasoning step by step.
- **Exercise:** Pose math problems and ask for step-by-step solutions.

### 10. System Prompts
- Set the behavior and role of the AI model before user interaction using system messages.
- **Exercise:** Modify the system prompt to change the assistant's tone.

### 11. Utilizing Prompt Types
- Demonstrate how system, user, and assistant prompts can be used together in a conversation.

### 12. Creating an AI Agent
- Build an AI agent that can perform tasks (e.g., arithmetic) using function calls.
- **Exercise:** Extend the agent with new functions and test with relevant prompts.
