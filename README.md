- Making API calls to LLMs using Python
- Structuring effective prompts using the CO-STAR framework
- Generating and parsing structured outputs (JSON/XML)
- Implementing chain-of-thought reasoning
- Understanding model limitations and tradeoffs
- Prototyping your first AI agent

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this assignment, students will be able to:

1. Configure and authenticate with LLM APIs (cloud or local)
2. Construct effective prompts using the CO-STAR framework
3. Generate structured outputs from natural language inputs
4. Implement chain-of-thought prompting techniques
5. Evaluate and document model limitations
6. Design and prototype a basic AI research agent
7. Compare tradeoffs between different LLM deployment options

---

## 📦 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the course repository
git clone https://github.com/inference-ai-course/Homework1-Submission.git
cd Homework1-Submission
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` should be set up already, but modify the optional section if needed, and feel free to use OpenAI API if you want. 

### Step 4: Configure API Keys (Path A or C)

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API key
```

⚠️ **Security Note:** The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and will never be committed to version control.

### Step 5: Verify Ollama Installation (Path B or C)

```bash
# Check Ollama is installed
ollama --version

# Pull recommended model
ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Test the model
ollama run llama3.2:3b "Hello, test!"
```

### Step 6: Open the Notebook in Your IDE

#### Option A: VS Code

```bash
# Install Python extension if not already installed
# Open VS Code
code .

# Open notebooks/00_setup_verification.ipynb first
# VS Code will prompt to select a kernel - choose your virtual environment
```

#### Option B: Cursor IDE (Recommended)

```bash
# Open Cursor
cursor .

# Open notebooks/00_setup_verification.ipynb first
# Select kernel: Python Environments → your virtual environment
```

## 🎮 Working with the Notebook

### Running Cells

The notebook is designed to be run **sequentially from top to bottom**. Each cell builds on previous cells.

```python
# Example: First cell sets up the environment
# DO NOT SKIP THIS CELL
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

print("✓ Environment loaded successfully")
```

### Path Selection

At the beginning of the notebook, you'll select your path:

```python
# CONFIGURATION: Choose your path
PATH = "A"  # Options: "A" (Claude), "B" (Ollama), "C" (Hybrid)

# The notebook will automatically configure based on your choice
```

### Code Cells vs Markdown Cells

- **Code cells** (gray background): Run these to execute Python code
- **Markdown cells** (white background): Read these for instructions and context
- **TODO cells**: These require you to fill in code or answers

```python
# TODO: Your code here
# Replace this comment with your implementation
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts (in Jupyter)

- `Shift + Enter`: Run current cell and move to next
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`: Run current cell and stay
- `A`: Insert cell above (in command mode)
- `B`: Insert cell below (in command mode)
- `DD`: Delete cell (in command mode)
- `M`: Convert to markdown (in command mode)
- `Y`: Convert to code (in command mode)

### Cursor IDE Features

If using Cursor IDE, you can:

- Use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to chat with AI about code
- Highlight code and ask AI for explanations
- Use AI to help debug errors
- **Remember:** Understand all AI-generated code before submitting

---

## 📝 Deliverables

### What Students Must Do

1. **Complete all notebooks in `notebooks/` (`00` through `08`)**

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How long should this assignment take?**  
**A:** Plan for 2-3 hours for core notebook completion, plus 1-2 hours for project brainstorming and documentation.

**Q: Can I use a different IDE?**  
**A:** Yes! Any IDE that supports Jupyter notebooks will work. VS Code, Cursor, JupyterLab, and PyCharm are all fine.

**Q: Do I need to use Cursor IDE?**  
**A:** No, it's optional. Any Python IDE works. Cursor is recommended for its AI features but not required.

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**  
**A:** You must write your own code, but discussing concepts and collaborative debugging is encouraged.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
**A:** Use Discord community, attend office hours, or consult documentation. Document your debugging process in the notebook.

### Path Selection

**Q: Which path should I choose?**  
**A:** Path A for best results and course alignment, Path B for zero cost and local learning, Path C for balanced approach.

**Q: Can I switch paths mid-assignment?**  
**A:** Yes! Change the `PATH` variable in the notebook and run the setup cells again.

**Q: Will smaller Ollama models work?**  
**A:** Yes, concepts are the same. Results will vary in quality but educational value remains high.

### Technical Issues

**Q: My computer can't run Ollama. What should I do?**  
**A:** Use Path A (Claude API) or explore cloud options like Google Colab with GPU.

**Q: The notebook won't open in my IDE**  
**A:** Ensure Jupyter extension is installed. For VS Code: Install "Jupyter" extension. For Cursor: Built-in support should work.

**Q: How do I know if my setup is correct?**  
**A:** Run the verification cells in Section 1. They'll report success or specific errors.

**Q: I'm getting API authentication errors**  
**A:** Check your `.env` file has correct key, reload environment, verify key is active in console.anthropic.com

### Cost Management

**Q: How can I minimize API costs?**  
**A:** Use Haiku for testing, implement caching, add delays, use shorter prompts during development, or use Ollama for experimentation.

**Q: What if I run out of credits?**  
**A:** Switch to Ollama (Path B) for remaining work, or contact instructor about alternative arrangements.

**Q: Can I use the free tier of Claude?**  
**A:** You'll need an API key with credits. Free tier chat.claude.com doesn't provide API access.
