## [Lecture](./lecture/)
- **Focus:** Prompt engineering with Jupyter Notebook
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Setup and initialization
  - Basic prompting
  - Summarization
  - Information extraction
  - Transformation (e.g., translation)
  - Expansion (creative generation)
  - Role-based, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
  - System prompts and agent creation
- **Format:** Step-by-step notebook with exercises

## [Homework](./homework/)
- **Focus:** Assignments and exercises for hands-on practice
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Fundamentals of prompt engineering
  - CO-STAR framework for structured prompting
  - Requesting/handling structured outputs (JSON, XML)
  - LLM behavior analysis and documentation
  - Advanced prompt design and model comparison
- **Instructions:** Complete all sections in the provided notebooks and document your findings.

## [Project](./project/)
- **Focus:** Advanced prompt engineering and structured outputs
- **Tasks Include:**
  1. Summarizing motivational passages
  2. Rewriting prompts using the CO-STAR framework
  3. Requesting outputs in JSON and XML formats
  4. Designing output schemas and validation rules
- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Master prompt engineering for clarity and structure
  - Apply frameworks and request structured outputs
  - Understand output validation for LLMs
