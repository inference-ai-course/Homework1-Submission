## 📋 Technical Interview Preparation Plan (6-8 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Assessment & Foundation**
- Take diagnostic tests on LeetCode/HackerRank to identify weak areas
- Review fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables)
- Refresh basic algorithms (sorting, searching, traversals)
- Research target company's interview format and commonly asked questions

### **Weeks 2-5: Intensive Practice Phase**

**Daily Routine:**
- Solve 2-3 coding problems with progressive difficulty (Easy → Medium → Hard)
- Document solutions with time/space complexity analysis
- Practice explaining solutions out loud

**Weekly Focus:**
- **Week 2:** Arrays & Strings
- **Week 3:** Trees & Graphs
- **Week 4:** Dynamic Programming
- **Week 5:** Advanced topics (Tries, Heaps, etc.)

**System Design (3-4 sessions/week, for mid-senior roles):**
- Study classic problems (URL shortener, Twitter, Netflix, Uber)
- Learn key concepts: scalability, load balancing, caching, CAP theorem
- Practice whiteboarding and articulating trade-offs
- Use resources like "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"

**Behavioral Prep (Ongoing):**
- Prepare 5-7 STAR stories (leadership, conflict, failure, teamwork, technical challenges)
- Practice common questions ("Tell me about yourself," "Why this company?")
- Research company values and culture
- Prepare thoughtful questions for interviewers

### **Week 6: Mock Interviews & Simulation**
- Schedule 2-3 mock interviews (Pramp, Interviewing.io, or with peers)
- Practice on whiteboard/shared coding environment
- Time yourself strictly (45 min coding, 60 min system design)
- Company-specific deep dive (Glassdoor, Blind, LeetCode company tags)
- Review and address feedback from mocks

### **Week 7-8: Review & Mental Preparation**
- Review notes and patterns from solved problems
- Solve 1-2 easy/medium problems daily (stay sharp, don't burn out)
- Practice behavioral story delivery
- Verify technical setup (quiet space, internet, backup device)
- Prioritize sleep and physical health
- Finalize company research and questions

### **Interview Day Strategy**
- **Morning:** Solve ONE easy warm-up problem only
- Arrive/log in 10-15 minutes early
- Have water, paper, and pen ready
- **During interview:**
  - Think out loud
  - Clarify requirements before coding
  - Discuss trade-offs
  - Test with examples
  - Ask for clarification if stuck
  - Manage time effectively
  - Stay positive between rounds

### **Post-Interview**
- Send thank-you notes
- Reflect on performance for future improvement
- Remember: interviews are two-way evaluations

## 🎯 Key Success Factors

1. **Quality over quantity** - Understanding patterns beats memorizing problems
2. **Realistic simulation** - Mock interviews build comfort under pressure
3. **Holistic preparation** - Communication and cultural fit matter as much as technical skills
4. **Track progress** - Use a spreadsheet to monitor weak areas and adjust
5. **Balance** - Avoid burnout by maintaining work-life balance

This plan balances consistent practice, realistic simulation, and comprehensive preparation across all interview dimensions!
