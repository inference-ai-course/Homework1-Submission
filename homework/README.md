# Class 1 Homework

This folder contains the assignments for Class 1 of the MLE in Gen AI course. The homework is divided into three main sections: `homework.ipynb`, `task3.ipynb`, and the `task1` folder. Each section focuses on different aspects of prompt engineering and large language model (LLM) behavior analysis.

## Contents

- [`homework.ipynb`](homework.ipynb):  
  Covers the fundamentals of prompt engineering, including:
  - Introduction to LLMs and prompt design
  - Using the CO-STAR framework for structured prompting
  - Requesting and handling structured outputs (such as JSON and XML)
  - Identifying and documenting LLM defects or unexpected behaviors

- [`task3.ipynb`](task3.ipynb):  
  Focuses on advanced prompt engineering tasks, including:
  - Designing prompts for specific use cases
  - Comparing outputs from different LLMs (e.g., OpenAI vs. Ollama)
  - Evaluating prompt effectiveness and model responses
  - Documenting findings and observations

- [`task1/`](task1/):  
  Contains additional exercises and resources to reinforce prompt engineering concepts and LLM analysis.

## Instructions

Work through all sections in `homework.ipynb`, `task3.ipynb`, and the `task1` folder. Follow the instructions and complete the exercises provided.
